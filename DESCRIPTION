Description: A method for detecting outliers with a Kalman filter on impulsed 
  noised outliers and prediction on cleaned data. 'kfino' is a robust 
  sequential algorithm allowing to filter data with a large number of outliers. 
  This algorithm is based on simple latent linear Gaussian processes as in the 
  Kalman Filter method and is devoted to detect impulse-noised outliers. These 
  are data points that differ significantly from other observations. 'ML' 
  (Maximization Likelihood) and 'EM' (Expectation-Maximization algorithm) 
  algorithms were implemented in 'kfino'. The method is described in full 
  details in the following arXiv e-Print: <arXiv:2208.00961>.
